Web Application for Text and Image Generation

A web application for text and image generation using GPT and DALL·E models allows users to input text prompts to generate 
both written content and images. The GPT model processes the input text to create coherent, contextually relevant responses, 
while the DALL·E model generates corresponding images based on the given descriptions. This dual functionality enables a 
seamless user experience where both creative writing and visual content can be produced from a single input. 
The application leverages advanced AI technologies to offer users an interactive and dynamic tool for generating content across multiple media types.
